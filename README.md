This program is my first effort at making a full machine learning program, going from data cleaning and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis / feature engineering to fitting the model.

Final product: MAE of +-0.62
(Range of reviews in dataset: 2.5 to 5 stars)

The two main problems I ran into while creating the program were:
1) Remembering that Decision Trees cannot take categorical variables as inputs (and dealing with that)
2) Using the right graphs and plots in Matplotlib to quantify information correctly

In the future, I hope to improve more on:
1) learning how to do more accurate EDA and use more than just box plots and histograms (AKA learn more Matplotlib)
2) learning how to handle categorical variables more efficiently when using a model such as a decision tree which doesn't use categorical variables
3) learning more hyper-parameters for Decision Trees and eventually learn about other models too

This was a nice first run-through of the full process, and I know that this'll help me as I go through the process again.

This program was created in Kaggle at the link here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukenelson1012/first-ml-mini-project-customer-shopping-trends
dataset is called "Customer Shopping (Latest Trends) Dataset," which can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/customer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset
